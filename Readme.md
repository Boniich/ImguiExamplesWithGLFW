# Imgui Example with GLFW 3 

This repo contains two example using Imgui and GLFW 3. This two example come from the Repo of Imgui.

Example in `main branch`: Normal imgui.  
Example in `docking branch`: Docking imgui

## Recommendations

If you compile the project of one branch (example: main), and then want to use the other project (docking branch), delete x64 folder just in case. Cause it may cause some problem.

- You can use the IDE of your preference
